Sometimes you work with different people during your PhD. This is where you can say what those people did and importantly what you did. \par

All of the work in Chapters \@ref(chapter1), \@ref(chapter2), \@ref(chapter3), and \@ref(chapter4) was performed and written by myself. I lead all of the work in Chapter \@ref(chapter2), which was conducted in collaboration with Person A, Person B, Person C, and Person D who all contributed to analysis 1. Person E and Person F shared scripts with me for X analysis, which I then used for reference in my analyses in Chapter \@ref(chapter1). Person G provided helpful guidance and feedback on the interpretation of results from results in Chapter \@ref(chapter2). \par
