This is where you can outline your thesis if you want to. If you don't need to do this then remove the lines:

```{latex}
outline: |
  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-outline.Rmd"), 
        collapse = '\n  ')`
```

from the `YAML` header in `index.Rmd`. I used this to give an outline (one paragraph) of the thesis as a whole, so what each chapter did. Then I had a paragraph on where all of the scripts and data for the thesis were stored and how to access these. \par
